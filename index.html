"Space exploration is a learning game, especially at this stage and we shouldn't look at this as a failure; we should look at this as an incredible engineering success," Sian Cleaver, Airbus' Orion European Service Module industrial manager, told the BBC's Today Programme.

"At one point it was looking like this mission was doomed, but a team of engineers and scientists managed to work together and to problem solve and to restore some capabilities of the spacecraft and ultimately direct it back to Earth," she said. "I think that's actually pretty impressive."

"There's a lot that we can take away from this, but ultimately space travel is difficult and we're seeing that here."

The fault was traced to leaking propellant from a ruptured oxidiser tank. This was generating a thrust, turning the craft and preventing it from keeping its solar panels constantly pointed at the Sun - vital to maintain a power supply.

Astrobotic posted a video on social media showing the spacecraft's view of Earth before it burned up.

The Astrobotic team worked the thrusters on Peregrine to restore stable pointing, but this of course used up even more of the rapidly depleting oxidiser.

Nonetheless, payloads onboard were activated, proving their space-worthiness, and some were even able to gather data, such as on the nature of the radiation environment between Earth and the Moon.

One of the Nasa instruments to be started up - the Peregrine Ion Trap Mass Spectrometer (PITMS) - had its sensor and electronics developed in the UK by the Open University and RAL Space.

The instrument was reported to be performing well in the check-out tests. The technology should have the opportunity to fly again on later lunar missions.
